## Specification
| Behavior        | Input           | Output  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| User can choose size of pizza  | small $6   | small $6 |

| User will see list of clickable pizzas ordered and upon click will see details |  Order 1  | small, olives & sausage, $9.50 |

## Setup/Installation Requirements
1. Clone the following repository: https://github.com/VicOhPNW/pizza-order.git
2. Open the index.html file in a browser.
3. Click the preferred options then submit for the total cost.

## Known Bugs
1. Does not calculate the sum of the toppings (values).
2. Choosing option "Pick-up" returns #NaN. I think this is because the value for "pick-up" is 0 and reading as false, but not confident. Did not seem to have this issue with an exercise earlier in the week.
